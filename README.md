GitHub Project: NYC High Schools Information

Project Description:
This project aims to create a native app to provide information about NYC High schools. The app will display a list of NYC High Schools with their additional information. The school list data can be obtained from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2 and the SAT scores can be obtained from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4.

The app will show the Math, Reading, and Writing SAT scores of the selected school. The additional information to be displayed is up to the developer's discretion.

The project should be named according to the following naming convention: [Your Name]-NYCSchools (e.g. JohnDoe-NYCSchools).

Note: The requirements are flexible, and the developer is encouraged to be creative while following clean coding practices to impress the reviewers.
